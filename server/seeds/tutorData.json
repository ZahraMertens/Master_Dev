I do so by integrating basic mathematical principles with fundamental coding approaches before moving on to more advanced concepts. My lessons are highly suitable for students who want to start learning programming from scratch and also for those who need help with understanding specific difficult concepts.",

Then tying that back to fundamentals so that we arenâ€™t just learning how to do things in specific environments, but so that you can take those skills and build on them to solve your own problems. I like story telling and explaining concepts in plain English before diving into the technicalities. I consider it a way of building bridges between where a student is and their intended destination.",
